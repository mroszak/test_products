Customers praise its speed, with the A13 Bionic chip providing snappy performance for everyday tasks, and its screen size, being neither too big nor too small while being convenient to carry around the city.","reviews":[{"author":"K. Watanabe","content":"Apple kept making and selling this 9th Gen (A13) iPad, even after releasing fancy new \u201call-screen\u201d 10th gen (A14) iPad at higher price. Probably to have a lower-cost choice in iPad lineup. Apple only stopped production about 6 months ago (in mid- 2024), selling stockpile as NEW during 2024 Holiday Season at great price. It\u2019s the last iPad with Touch ID Home Button, which I prefer over the Touch ID on side Power Button (or Face ID). It\u2019s also the last iPad with headphones jack, which I appreciate. It works with 1st Gen Apple Pencil if you already have one from older iPad. It charges over Lightning connector, which is fine for me because all my devices (except my MacBook) still charge using Lightning (not USB-C). Performance is excellent for what I do with an iPad. The screen looks great. Long battery life (including standby time) per charge.","helpful_count":40,"id":"RS0ZL8IR3ZSH","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Style: WiFi, Size: 64GB, Color: Space Gray, Configuration: Without AppleCare+","profile_id":"AFDJC4OJYIYEUKYMM3FNZNSE2YNA","rating":5,"review_from":"Top reviews from the United States","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2024","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars A proven older design, one last time, at super discount."},{"author":"Yan","content":"This iPad is great for everyday tasks, whether browsing, streaming, or taking notes.

Got this - it does everything we need it to do and also like the fact it uses the first generation Apple Pencil, which we already had, as well as the older charging port so we can use all of our old charging cords for this. Another perk of this older model is that it has the headphone jack - that is huge for us as we don't use wireless earbuds.Charges up faster than my old one - holds a charge very well. These things are more durable than one would expect, but we have been through 3 since kids were little and never a single scratch without ever using a screen protector!The iPad we replaced with this one was from 2016 and since they are supported for about 7 years we will get a good 4 years out of this one from when we purchased it. I got an incredible deal on Black Friday that made it impossible to pass up. Very glad I didn't get a newer model and then have to buy all the new blocks and cables...which also helps keep everyone else from steal my charging stuff since I use the newer USB-C cords! It's all about strategy!","id":"RGOO6XM7EDH76","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Style: WiFi, Size: 256GB, Color: Silver, Configuration: Without AppleCare+","profile_id":"AF5XCCIPEJONXXL2IJ7IUFLOFW3Q","rating":5,"review_from":"Top reviews from the United States","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2025","title":"5.0 out of 5 stars Has Headphone Jack & older style lightening connector so will use the cords/blocks you already have!"},{"author":"Debbie","content":"9th gen, screen 10.2.

We needed a tablet that could run zoom and \"virtual learning\" things more smoothly than our daughter's fire tablet. We were also looking for something she can play Roblox on without all the glitches that comes with Fire tablets. We found this on sale for the same price as a Fire 10 which seemed like a steal, so we went ahead and got it. I am very glad, because it just runs a lot more smoothly in general than fire tablets (which is the only other type we've had for her). It seems to charge at a decent speed, and the battery holds for several days. Although she doesn't use it very frequently during the week so maybe if she used it more, it wouldn't last as long.I will say shipping took forever. It was supposed to be a 1 week ship and it got delayed and took 2 weeks.Also, a notice for android users: It was really hard for me to set up for a kids tablet. I do love that there are kid setting options, but setting it up was very confusing for me, as an android user. And thank goodness my wife is an apple girly, because it seems like it would be very hard to navigate the kids side on the parent account without another apple device. I am the tech setter-upper in the house, and I'm sure this was user error, but I ended up having to go through all my wife's accounts to set it up rather than my own. Also (in case you're not used to apples), it seems like you cannot set it up for an adult and then add the child account onto the same device, like you would be able to for a Fire. It has to solely be set up for that child and then managed on a second apple device.Overall it works very well, looks shnazzy, serves all our purposes, and was a great price.","helpful_count":80,"id":"R252N4LUDXS3UG","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Style: WiFi, Size: 64GB, Color: Space Gray, Configuration: Without AppleCare+","profile_id":"AFMKNB3FF2IEI7WFG7ZJWESTU73A","rating":4,"review_from":"Top reviews from the United States","timestamp":"Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2024","title":"4.0 out of 5 stars Perfect for my child but hard to set up"},{"author":"Mariana Gorrin","content":"The iPad 2021 is fantastic!

Os 64 GB de espa\u00e7o d\u00e1 pra usar tranquilo por muito tempo sem precisar apagar arquivos. Eu substitu\u00ed o meu iPad Air 1\u00aa Gera\u00e7\u00e3o de 2014 com 16 GB de espa\u00e7o que usei desde 2014 mesmo, e a diferen\u00e7a pra esse modelo aqui \u00e9 ABSURDA!- A bateria dura bastante. Como eu uso muito o iPad, eu tenho que recarreg\u00e1-lo a cada 2 dias. Isso porque eu uso Instagram, Twitter, Podcasts, HBO Max, Prime Video, YouTube e aplicativos de notas para estudo na faculdade (al\u00e9m de pesquisas no Safari). O sistema diz que eu tenho uma m\u00e9dia de 7h de uso di\u00e1rio. O recarregamento \u00e9 muito r\u00e1pido, vai de 10% a 100% em 40min~1h. Isso pra mim \u00e9 r\u00e1pido. S\u00f3 recarrego novamente 2 dias depois. Pra mim d\u00e1 muita seguran\u00e7a de que n\u00e3o me deixa na m\u00e3o.- Eu n\u00e3o tenho a Apple Pencil porque \u00e9 MUITO cara, ent\u00e3o comprei uma da GooJoDoq 12\u00aa gera\u00e7\u00e3o no Al1expr3ss, foi 94 reais, e ela \u00e9 perfeita! \u00c9 perfeito pra escrever. \u00danica coisa que s\u00f3 a Apple Pencil tem \u00e9 a sensibilidade de press\u00e3o. Quem for artista ou tiver objetivo de um iPad para desenho, talvez a falta de sensor de press\u00e3o para a caneta GooJoDoq fa\u00e7a diferen\u00e7a, ent\u00e3o ter\u00e1 que comprar a Apple Pencil mesmo. Para mim, n\u00e3o faz diferen\u00e7a e a caneta \u00e9 realmente MUITO boa.- A c\u00e2mera \u00e9 boa, mas tem um filtro t\u00edpico da Apple que n\u00e3o me agrada muito, deixa a cara um pouco lavada. Por\u00e9m a tecnologia de Palco Central e desfoque do fundo nativo s\u00e3o realmente muito bons. D\u00e1 um aspecto mais profissional em liga\u00e7\u00f5es por v\u00eddeos. Os microfones tamb\u00e9m s\u00e3o excelentes, dando op\u00e7\u00f5es para isolamento de voz, que retira todo o ru\u00eddo em volta e foca s\u00f3 na sua voz. \u00c9 incr\u00edvel isso.- Um ponto negativo desse iPad \u00e9 o sensor de press\u00e3o digital n\u00e3o ser muito r\u00e1pido e s\u00f3 funcionar com a tela acordada. Ent\u00e3o voc\u00ea tem que apertar um bot\u00e3o pra ligar a tela e ent\u00e3o colocar o dedo no sensor pra desbloquear. \u00c9 uma inconveni\u00eancia, que dentro de todas as qualidades desse iPad eu acho que \u00e9 s\u00f3 um gr\u00e3o na areia.- Por fim, eu paguei 2700 em Mar\u00e7o/2022, pela loja Tech Play Store. Recomendo a loja, a entrega foi r\u00e1pida e o iPad \u00e9 realmente novo, lacrado, com garantia oficial no site da Apple.","id":"RCI8Q3DQVNK9N","is_verified":true,"product_attributes":"Style: WiFi, Size: 64GB, Color: Silver, Configuration: Without AppleCare+","rating":5,"review_from":"Top reviews from other countries","timestamp":"Reviewed in Brazil May 3, 2022","title":"Ele \u00e9 realmente incr\u00edvel (2 meses de uso)"}],"reviews_count":74728,"sales_rank":[],"sales_volume":"1K+ bought","sns_discounts":[],"stock":"In Stock","store_url":"/stores/Apple/page/77D9E1F7-0337-4282-9DB6-B6B8FB2DC98D?lp_asin=B09G9FPHY6&ref_=ast_bln","title":"Apple iPad (9th Generation): with A13 Bionic chip, 10.2-inch Retina Display, 64GB, Wi-Fi, 12MP front/8MP Back Camera, Touch ID, All-Day Battery Life \u2013 Space Gray","url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6","variation":[{"asin":"B09G91TLNJ","dimensions":{"Color":"Silver","Configuration":"Without AppleCare+","Size":"256GB","Style":"WiFi"},"selected":false},{"asin":"B09G9GLLRN","dimensions":{"Color":"Space Gray","Configuration":"Without AppleCare+","Size":"64GB","Style":"WiFi + Cellular"},"selected":false},{"asin":"B09G96TFF7","dimensions":{"Color":"Space Gray","Configuration":"Without AppleCare+","Size":"256GB","Style":"WiFi"},"selected":false},{"asin":"B09G9CJM1Z","dimensions":{"Color":"Silver","Configuration":"Without AppleCare+","Size":"64GB","Style":"WiFi"},"selected":false},{"asin":"B0B5Z97XDZ","dimensions":{"Color":"Space Gray","Configuration":"With AppleCare+ (2 Years)","Size":"256GB","Style":"WiFi"},"selected":false},{"asin":"B09G9FPHY6","dimensions":{"Color":"Space Gray","Configuration":"Without AppleCare+","Size":"64GB","Style":"WiFi"},"selected":true},{"asin":"B09G97CV82","dimensions":{"Color":"Silver","Configuration":"Without AppleCare+","Size":"256GB","Style":"WiFi + Cellular"},"selected":false},{"asin":"B09G9LD3HC","dimensions":{"Color":"Silver","Configuration":"Without AppleCare+","Size":"64GB","Style":"WiFi + Cellular"},"selected":false},{"asin":"B09G96P9RM","dimensions":{"Color":"Space Gray","Configuration":"Without AppleCare+","Size":"256GB","Style":"WiFi + Cellular"},"selected":false}],"warranty_and_support":{"description":"Product Warranty: For warranty information about this product, please click here","links":[{"title":"click here","url":"/gp/feature.html/ref=dp_warranty_request_3P?docId=1002406021"}]}}]}
